# Overview

# Description of Files
**Performance At The Olympics By Country Between 2000-2024.xlsx** - This is a Microsoft Excel file (in .xlsx format) that contains data relating to performance by all countries in the Olympics between 2000 (Sydney, Australia) through to 2024 (Paris, France). It can be opened with Microsoft Excel (proprietary), Libre Office Calc (open-source/free), or a similar related program.

# Additional Notes
1. Some countries, such as Georgia, technically straddle between two continents. Where this happens, for the purposes of the spreadsheet "Performance At The Olympics By Country Between 2000-2024", the continent entered into the entry was determined by a coin flip. This fact has also been noted in the spreadsheet itself as well as the paper.
